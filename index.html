                <p> Hi! I'm Ben, a Cornell sophomore studying computer science with an intended minor in game design. 
                    I do research at the Cornell Program of Computer Graphics, investigating the intersection 
                    of visual perception, virtual reality, and eye tracking. Right now, I'm trying to get a handle on
                    graphics fundamentals and 3D game development. This site displays some of the projects
                    I've worked on outside of class. Thanks for checking it out! </p>

            <div id="OpenGL">
            <h2 class="pTitle">OpenGL App</h2>
            <div class="gallery">
                <img src="images/GIF1.gif" alt="Ground perspective of simple cube world in OpenGL"/>
                <img src="images/GIF2.gif" alt="Overhead perspective of simple cube world in OpenGL"/>
            </div>
            <p>I've been learning some OpenGL to help me get a better understanding of the 3D graphics pipeline.
                This project was created from scratch with OpenGL and C++. It uses Perlin noise to generate a small 
                world of cubes that can be explored from a first-person perspective with WASD and mouse controls.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm interested in making my own small 3D games in OpenGL, since I'll get a better
                understanding of what goes on under the hood than if I used Unity or Unreal. I'm currently learning
                more about OpenGL and game engines so I can make more complex projects. 
            </p>

            <div id="Pulse">
            <h2 class="pTitle">Pulse</h2>
            <div class="gallery">
                <img src="images/Pulse1.jpg" alt="Pulse app splash screen"/>
                <img src="images/Pulse2.jpg" alt="Pulse authentication screen"/>
                <img src="images/Pulse3.jpg" alt="Pulse playlist view screen"/>
            </div>
            <p>
                Pulse is an iOS app created in a group of 5 for the 2021 AppDev Hack Challenge at Cornell.
                The idea is to provide insights on user listening habits for a specific community, like a college
                campus, to help with music discovery. I focused on front-end development in Swift, working on connecting to the 
                Spotify API and handling account authentication, sending user data to a Heroku app, and turning the data into playlists.
